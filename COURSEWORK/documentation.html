                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>This demonstration website was created for the coursework purposes, specifically for the 1st
                    coursework
                    assignment of SOFT20181: Internet Application Programming module, year 2019/2020.
                    <br>
                    Task assigned was to create a front end only static webpage for the fictional web shop company
                    (named
                    CWKS in my solution). Product catalogue is stored in an xml file and all non-static information’s
                    are
                    loaded from it using JSON.
                    <br>
                    Main idea and guideline when writing this code was ability to reuse most of the code later in the
                    module, so code is written in a way that items like slideshow images, products names and description
                    can
                    be filled in automatically (something like a template). This resulted in ability to add more
                    products,
                    categories and therefore slideshows and product description pages by simply modifying XML file
                    contents,
                    without need to touch source code of the webpage.
                    <br>
                    All goals mentioned in the Assignment specification document and more are demonstrated in following
                    html
                    files:
                    <br>

                                <li>
                                    Self-coded JavaScript slideshow, in which images are automatically loaded from items
                                    specified in
                                    xml
                                    file, sorted and added to slideshow
                                </li>

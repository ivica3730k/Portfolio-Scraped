                     Computer Hardware and Software. Always aiming for the best, I explored numerous oppurtunities to
                     improve my skills in any possible way. Because of that I have quite big list of projects behind me
                     ,it being personal or group ones. List of my projects, with details, is available below:

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">During first term at the University, we were given a group
                           project to do called "Cattle Data Tool."</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Aim of the project was to develop an tracking aplication for the
                           cattle that has tracking devices attached to them, and from that data later determine
                           physical health of the Cow/Bull...That piece of sotware that we have developed is a part of
                           experimental work with sensors and livestock, and is a part of a bigger project.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">I was in charge of Data part of the project, creating database,
                           importing files and sorting them all togather. For database I have used SQLite 3 database.
                           Programing language for whole solution is Python.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">My group and I were awarded with the highest grade for our
                           solution.<br /><br /></p>

                     <div class="container">
                        <p>One of my bigest project was developing of my own product called:&nbsp;<strong>"Universal IoT
                              Development board."</strong></p>
                        <p>At that time, board consisted of all electronic parts in one simple package, that was easy to
                           use, in order to allow any user, even without any programming experience to quickly got their
                           own IoT thing up in the cloud.</p>
                        <p>I personaly made all Electronic plans, manufactured board files, ordered blank board from
                           China and populated it with neccesary compoments with my own soldering skills. All that at my
                           own little workshop back in Croatia.</p>
                        <p>At that time, board was based on ESP8266 chip, and it included:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>SMPS Power Supply</li>
                           <li>16 Digital IO Ports</li>
                           <li>6 ADC Ports</li>
                           <li>5 DAC Outputs</li>
                           <li>RTC Clock</li>
                           <li>Oprional HC-05 Bluetooth module</li>
                           <li>Optional DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>...all packed in small form factor of 100*60mm.</p>
                        <p>That board was probably my bigest project I have completed so far. All my knowledge and
                           skills were recognized. So, board granted me multiple awards in the field,like:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>Award for best Final Dissertation on topic "Universal IoT development board", Slavonski
                              Brod,Croatia.May 2018.</li>
                           <li>1st place for "Universal IoT Development board" at regional Croatian contest "Mladi @
                              Inovacije 2018"</li>
                           <li>2nd place for "Universal IoT Development board" at "Science Fair Ivanic grad 2018"</li>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Back when I was at my high school in Croatia, I have designed
                           simple RC Controled Vehicle called simply "Arduino RC Car." I created it in order to compite
                           at the croatian science fair "Science Fair Ivanic Grad, 2017."&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Car consisted of 4WD electric system and was fully controlable
                           over app on any Android device. Range was decent and battery life was good enough to last
                           trough all 2 days of constant use.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The car was quite popular, bringing attention to young kids at
                           the age of elementary school, probably inspiring them to be a "Techonolgy" persons one
                           day.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">That project granted me 3rd place, bronze medal for that contest
                           in that year.</p>

                           &ldquo;Robo Challenge&rdquo; project that was held in my school back in Croatia.</p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Aim of the project was to introduce world of
                           electronic and applied Software Engineering to the young students like me at that time.
                           Project was separated in two main parts. First part was to assemble a robotic vehicle using
                           appropriate tools, schematics and tools. Second part was to program that vehicle In order for
                           it to do certain tasks like avoid an obstacle, follow line on floor, or to enable remote
                           control.</p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">My colleagues and I were very successful at
                           that project and we have completed out tasks, and additional ones in time span of 2 weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This project is one of my favourites because
                           at that time, I was only 15 years old, and this was my first big step into the world of
                           programming.</p>

                           &Scaron;kofja Loka,Slovenia, sponsored by Siemens.</p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">There I was provided full training in PLC
                           programming and additional compressed air storage and saving procedures. <span
                              style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I had opportunity to see from personal experience
                           how things are working in the industry and how to adopt my skillset for industry need in
                           future.</p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Training lasted 3 days in total and in the end
                           I was awarded with the Certificate from the Education centre.</p>

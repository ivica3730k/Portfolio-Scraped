              <p>During my time in High School, and now, I have been very active in the world of Electronics,
                Computer Hardware and Software. Always aiming for the best, I explored numerous opportunities to
                improve my skills in any possible way. Because of that I have quite big list of projects behind me,
                it being personal or group ones. List of my projects, with details, is available below:

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">IoT Storage Box is my latest little project used to enable small embedded
                    IoT devices to store the data on the Web.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> It works by IoT devices visiting an url endpoint, providing the data and 
                    api key that you set yourself. There is also an web instance you can use free of charge.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Aim of the project was to develop an tracking application for the

                    schedule the events.

                    experimental work with sensors and livestock and is a part of a bigger project.

                  <p>One of my biggest projects was developing of my product called:&nbsp;<strong>"Universal IoT
                    Development Board."</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that time, board consisted of all electronic parts in one simple package, that was easy to
                    use, to allow any user, even without any programming experience to quickly got their
                    own IoT thing up in the cloud.
                  </p>
                  <p>I made all Electronic plans, manufactured board files, ordered the blank board from
                    China and populated it all by myself.
                  </p>
                  <p>At that time, the board was based on ESP8266 chip, and it included:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>SMPS Power Supply</li>
                    <li>16 Digital IO Ports</li>
                    <li>6 ADC Ports</li>
                    <li>5 DAC Outputs</li>
                    <li>RTC Clock</li>
                    <li>Optional HC-05 Bluetooth module</li>
                    <li>Optional DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>...all packed in small form factor of 100*60mm.</p>
                  <p>That board was probably my biggest project I have completed so far. All my knowledge and
                    skills were recognized. So, the board granted me multiple awards in the field:

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Back when I was at my high school in Croatia, I have designed
                    simple RC Controlled Vehicle called simply "Arduino RC Car." I created it to compete
                    at the Croatian science fair "Science Fair Ivanić Grad, 2017."&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Car consisted of 4WD electric system and was fully controllable
                    over the app on any Android device. The range was decent and battery life was good enough to last
                    through all 2 days of constant use.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">That project granted me 3rd place bronze medal</p>

                    &ldquo;Robo Challenge&rdquo; project that was held in my school back in Croatia.
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Aim of the project was to introduce world of
                    electronic and applied Software Engineering to young students like me at that time.
                    The project was separated into two main parts. The first part was to assemble a robotic vehicle using
                    appropriate tools, schematics and tools. The second part was to program that vehicle For
                    it to do certain tasks like avoiding an obstacle, follow the line on the floor, or to enable remote
                    control.
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">My colleagues and I were very successful at
                    that project and we have completed out tasks, and additional ones in time span of 2 weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This project is one of my favourites because
                    at that time, I was only 15 years old, and this was my first big step into the world of
                    programming.

                    opportunity to further increase my skills in programming by visiting MIC Education centre in
                    &Scaron;kofja Loka,Slovenia, sponsored by Siemens.
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">There I was provided full training in PLC

                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Training lasted 3 days in total and in the end
                    I was awarded with the Certificate from the Education centre.
